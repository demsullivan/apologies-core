### Apologies! Core

This repo contains the core game logic for a Sorry! clone that I'm building in Unity.

I've structured the code so that there's an abstracted core that isn't concerned with
how the game interacts with the end user, so it could theoretically be ported to any
game engine, could be written as a web or CLI app, etc.

This is also my first major codebase written in C#. I've tinkered with C# a little bit
in doing Unity tutorials, but I've never written a standalone codebase in C#.

We'll see how this goes :)
